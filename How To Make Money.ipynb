    "Welcome to the great nation of Dystopianistan. The eternal leader is Kimberly Il-Smith. Here in Dystopianistan, things are done slightly differently from how you know them to be. But there are some quite familiar things. We'll start with one of them: the idea of `Bank`s\n",
    "\n",
    "`Bank`s provide a place for the citizens of Dystopianistan to store their money. It also provides loans to any citizen who needs it. Loans in Dystopianistan are rather simple - there is no concept of compound interest. Also, all loans are set for a fixed period of time\n",
    "\n",
    "`Bank`s loan money with special rules - they can loan more than they actually have. If a `Bank` holds \\$200 in its holdings, it can loan up to \\$1000. The reason is because through a lot of study, it's been found that the citizens of Dystopianistan are generally good debtors - they pay back whatever they owe, plus interest, most of the time. This allows the banks to count on future returns, and so they're allowed to lend out more money than they have in store."
